## Deployment (Fly.io)

The service is deployed via [`fly.toml`](https://github.com/Treevu-ai/cli-market-backend/blob/main/fly.toml). The collector daemon uses [`fly.collector.toml`](https://github.com/Treevu-ai/cli-market-backend/blob/main/fly.collector.toml) and runs [`collect_prices.py`](https://github.com/Treevu-ai/cli-market-backend/blob/main/collect_prices.py) on a 4-hour cycle.

Required env vars on Fly.io (`fly secrets set ...`):

```
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...
PORT=8080
MARKET_API_URL=https://cli-market-api.fly.dev
```

---

## Dev setup

```
pip install -r requirements.txt -r requirements-private.txt
uvicorn market_server:app --reload --port 8765
```

Tests:

```
pytest tests/
```

## Semantic enrichment pipeline

Every product that passes through the API is enriched with canonical identities from `cli-market-index`:

```
collect_prices.py (4h cycle)
       |
       v
  search / orders routers
       |
       v
  index_gate.enrich_list()   -- identical to cli-market-index/index_gate.py
       |
       v
  normalized units + brands  -- from cli-market-index normalizers (single source of truth)
       |
       v
  'index' block in response  -> { id, canonical_name, confidence, measurement }
```

The `index_gate.py` bridge delegates to `cli-market-index` `IndexService` with persistent Golden Records (Postgres in production, SQLite in dev).
