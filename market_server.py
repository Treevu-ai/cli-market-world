"""
market-server — Agentic Market backend.

Thin FastAPI app factory. ALL endpoint code lives in routers/*.py and
business logic in market_core.py / server_deps.py.

To run:
    python market_server.py
    → http://localhost:8765
    → http://localhost:8765/docs

Adding a new endpoint:
    1. Pick the router that fits the domain (or create routers/<domain>.py).
    2. Define the endpoint there with `@router.<method>(path)`.
    3. If you're creating a new router, register it below with
       `app.include_router(<new>_router)`.

There are NO inline @app.<method> endpoints here. If you find yourself
about to add one — instead, find or create the right router.
